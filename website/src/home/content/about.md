# About

Compa is an open initiative to promote collaboration and knowledge sharing among students at higher education institutions.

As a fresher, settling into school could be easier. You usually need to find:

- Communities/Clubs you are interested in
- Semester timetables
- Resources from past semesters

For continuing students, it's just as hard to find documents or class notes when conversations are scattered across multiple platforms.

Being a student is hard enough, we know. That's why Compa aims to be the go-to resource for higher education institutions and save you from one source of stress.

Your open, compact, companion and compass. That is _Compa_.
