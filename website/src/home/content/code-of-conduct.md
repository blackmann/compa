# Code of Conduct

Compa aims to provide resources to students across the world. Diversity is one of our strengths and we want to ensure that everyone feels welcome and included. This code applies to everyone in our community, across all platforms.

This is not an exhaustive list but instead a guideline for you. Use your best judgement and consider the impact of your actions on others, and the community as whole as you use Compa.

- Be friendly.
- Be patient.
- Be welcoming.
- Be considerate.
- Assume good intentions.
- Choose your words carefully.
- Be respectful.

The following are not tolerated:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Moderators are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our code of conduct and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be
reported to the moderators responsible for enforcement at the Compa Discord server:

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Moderators are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
