# Compa

A companion application for students to manage and access resources at their higher education institution.

## About

As a fresher, settling into school could be easier. You usually need to find:

- Communities/Clubs you are interested in
- Semester timetables
- Resources from past semesters

For continuing students, it's just as hard to find documents or class notes when conversations are scattered across multiple platforms.

Being a student is hard enough, that's why Compa aims to be the go-to resource for higher education institutions and save you from one source of stress.

Your open, compact, companion and compass. That is _Compa_.

## Features

- [x] Timetable: See the lecture schedule for a semester and import it to your calendar. ❇️

- [x] Discussions: Ask questions, share ideas and interact with other students.

- [ ] Communities: Find and join groups that interest you.

## Schools

- [x] Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) - <https://knust.compa.so>

> If you'd like to set up Compa for your school, please create an issue with the title: `School Request: <School Name>`.
